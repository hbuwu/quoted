# Quoted

All your Quoted needs.

## What is this app

This is an assignment for my course AFEC (Advanced Front End Coding). I will probably update some aspects along with the extra lessons we'll be given.

### Structure / Features

#### `Home page`

Nothing much here, it's just a home page.
Used a router for the navigation, and the footer includes a useState and useEffect. Both of these have been used throughout this application.

#### `Form Quote`

Tested out `react-hook-form`.

#### `Quotes`

Page where I made new components by mapping through data from a JSON file.

#### `Contact`

Here I tested out how to fetch data from an API
